/// A powerful, actor-based rate limiter providing multi-window rate limiting with exponential backoff.
///
/// `RateLimiter` is designed for high-performance, security-first rate limiting scenarios. It supports
/// multiple time windows, exponential backoff for consecutive failures, comprehensive metrics collection,
/// and follows industry-standard patterns used by platforms like GitHub, AWS, and Stripe.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Thread-Safe**: Built with Swift's actor model for concurrent access
/// - **Multi-Window**: Support layered rate limits (e.g., 5/min AND 100/hour)
/// - **Security-First**: Immediate exponential backoff on consecutive failures
/// - **Memory Efficient**: Bounded cache with LRU eviction
/// - **Generic Design**: Works with any `Hashable & Sendable` key type
/// - **Metrics Ready**: Built-in monitoring and analytics hooks
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a simple rate limiter
/// let limiter = RateLimiter<String>(
///     windows: [.minutes(1, maxAttempts: 10)]
/// )
///
/// // Check rate limit
/// let result = await limiter.checkLimit("user123")
/// if result.isAllowed {
///     // Process request
/// } else {
///     // Handle rate limit exceeded
///     print("Rate limited. Retry after: \(result.backoffInterval ?? 0) seconds")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Multi-Window Rate Limiting
///
/// Layer multiple time windows for comprehensive protection:
///
/// ```swift
/// let apiLimiter = RateLimiter<String>(
///     windows: [
///         .minutes(1, maxAttempts: 60),    // Burst protection
///         .hours(1, maxAttempts: 1000),    // Hourly limit
///         .hours(24, maxAttempts: 10000)   // Daily limit
///     ]
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Security Features
///
/// The rate limiter implements security-first principles:
///
/// - **Immediate Backoff**: Any consecutive failure triggers exponential penalties
/// - **Progressive Penalties**: Each failure increases backoff duration exponentially
/// - **Attack Prevention**: Stops brute force and credential stuffing attacks
/// - **Memory Protection**: Bounded cache prevents memory exhaustion
///
/// ## Topics

/// - ``WindowConfig``
///
/// ### Checking Limits
///

public actor RateLimiter<Key: Hashable & Sendable>: Sendable {

    /// Configuration for a rate limiting time window.
    ///
    /// A `WindowConfig` defines a time period and the maximum number of attempts allowed within that period.
    /// Multiple windows can be layered to create sophisticated rate limiting policies.
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Create different window configurations
    /// let burst = WindowConfig.minutes(1, maxAttempts: 10)
    /// let hourly = WindowConfig.hours(1, maxAttempts: 1000)
    /// let daily = WindowConfig(duration: 86400, maxAttempts: 10000)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Window Sorting
    ///

    /// The shortest window is checked first, ensuring the most restrictive limit applies.

    ///   - maxCacheSize: The maximum number of unique keys to track simultaneously. When exceeded, least recently used entries
    ///                  are evicted. Defaults to 10000.
    ///   - backoffMultiplier: The factor by which the backoff duration increases after each consecutive failure.
    ///                       For example, with a multiplier of 2.0 and a window of 1 hour, consecutive failures would

    /// This is the core method of the rate limiter. It evaluates all configured windows and applies
    /// security-first backoff policies to determine if a request should proceed.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - key: The unique identifier for the rate limit check (e.g., user ID, API key, IP address).
    ///   - timestamp: The timestamp for this check. Defaults to the current time from the dependency system.
    ///                Useful for testing scenarios where time needs to be controlled.

    /// - Returns: A ``RateLimitResult`` containing the decision and relevant metadata including backoff times,
    ///           remaining attempts, and when the next attempt would be allowed.
    ///
    /// ## Behavior
    ///
    /// The method applies a security-first approach:
    /// 1. **Immediate Backoff**: If there are consecutive failures, applies exponential backoff regardless of rate limits
    /// 2. **Multi-Window Validation**: Checks all configured windows in ascending duration order
    /// 3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes expired window data to maintain memory efficiency
    /// 4. **Metrics Integration**: Calls the optional metrics callback with results
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let result = await rateLimiter.checkLimit("user123")
    /// 
    /// if result.isAllowed {
    ///     // Process the request
    ///     print("Request allowed. Remaining: \(result.remainingAttempts)")

    ///
    /// ## Usage Pattern
    ///
    /// ```swift

    /// // User can now make requests as if they never used the system

    /// ## When to Use
    ///
    /// - **Administrative Actions**: Manually clearing a user's rate limit history
    /// - **Account Recovery**: Resetting limits after resolving account issues  
    /// - **Testing**: Clearing state between test scenarios
    /// - **Policy Changes**: Starting fresh after rate limit configuration updates
    /// - **False Positives**: Clearing limits incorrectly applied to legitimate users
    ///
